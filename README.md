this is a generative art twitter bot locaed at https://twitter.com/_color_genie_

you need to add your own config.js file to make this work! i think if i uploaded mine you could end up tweeting onto my account. hmm... which might actually be cool for another project!<br><br>
i love daniel shiffman ! the bot part was all done from his amazing tutorial series:

you will need to change the file path in the bot.js file probably! also the bot_windows.js has a different line to run the processing command cause windows is weird!
